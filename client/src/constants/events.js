// âœ… This code is a module that exports constants representing various events in a chat application. These constants are used to identify specific actions or notifications that can occur within the application, such as sending messages, receiving alerts, and managing chat states. By using constants, the code improves readability and maintainability, making it easier to manage event-driven interactions in the chat system.
